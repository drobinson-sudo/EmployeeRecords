# EmployeeRecords
An MSAccess Database to keep track of employee information

Employee information such as address, telephone, etc can be maintained,
as well as time-off requests, call-outs, pay rates/raises, etc.

Reports can be generated as well. Currently reports exist for 
a call-out log and an employee telephone list.
